# RSA
Rational speech act

See example.py for an example of how to run an experiment.

You can use run_experiment to use the model. You need to give it the utterances, worlds, depth, cost, and rationality.

Before that, you need to create utterance instances of possible utterances, and world instances of possible worlds.
To make an utterance instance you need to give an interpretation of possible utterances and the utterances themselves.
To make a world you need to give the world and its prior.
